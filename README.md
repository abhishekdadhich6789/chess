# ♟️ Chess Game  

A fully functional chess game built with **TypeScript**, featuring player vs. player gameplay, move validation, and a clean UI.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements the complete rules of chess, including valid moves, captures, check, and checkmate detection. It is designed to be simple, modular, and extendable for future improvements such as AI opponents or online multiplayer.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- Standard **8x8 chessboard** with all rules implemented.  
- Move validation (legal moves only).  
- Highlights possible moves for each piece.  
- Game end conditions: checkmate, stalemate, and draw.  
- Written in **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.  
- Modular structure (`api.ts`, `index.ts`) for scalability.
